# VelibFlow
VelibFlow is a machine learning project that aims to predict the availability of bikes and free parking spots in VÃ©lib stations. By leveraging predictive algorithms, users can anticipate the availability of bikes and make informed decisions, and the Velib company can optimize the redistribution flow within the bike-sharing system.
